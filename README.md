ENG 100 Arduino project
=======================

Blinks an LED (Pin 13) and produces a tone in a speaker (Pin 8) according to what morse code would be for the word specified in the arduino code.

Todo:
* Make an LCD screen display the current word as well
* Read words from a database and randomly select one to display, so it isn't only specified in the code
* Allow users to switch between words using button on LCD screen so they can go to a new randomly selected word if desired
